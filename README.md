# Insufficient Error Handling in Asynchronous Dart Code

This repository demonstrates a common, yet often overlooked, error in asynchronous Dart code: inadequate error handling. The `bug.dart` file showcases a function that fetches data from an API but has insufficient error handling.  The `bugSolution.dart` file provides a more robust solution.

## Bug
The original code attempts to fetch data from an API but only partially handles potential errors.  Specifically, it lacks handling of various HTTP errors and other exceptions that may occur during network requests or JSON decoding.  This can lead to unexpected application crashes or silent failures.

## Solution
The improved code in `bugSolution.dart` provides more complete error handling.  It explicitly checks for HTTP error codes, catches exceptions that may occur during JSON decoding, and provides more informative error logging to aid debugging.
